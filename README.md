# Handwritten Digit Recognition
This Project is implementation of Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning.

This can be used in image processing and predicting digits .

The model is trained on MNIST Dataset.
This implementation works on Convolutional neural network to train the model on dataset containing images of all 10 digit.
MNIST Dataset have thousands of images which is divided in test and training set.

Model is trained on training set and its performance is evaluated on test set.

On training set accuracy was 99.95 percent which may seem to be case of overfitting but Accuracy acheived on test set was 99.35 percent which can be reliable.

The implementation can be found in Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb .
The trained model is saved as Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.h5 ,which can be used to make predictions easily.
