# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
This Project is implementation of Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning.
The model is trained on MNIST Dataset.
This implementation works on Convolutional neural network to train the model on dataset containing images of all 10 digit.
MNIST Dataset have thousands of images which is divided in test and training set.
So model is trained on training set and its performance is evaluated on test set.

Accuracy acheived on test set was 99.35 percent.

Its jupyter notebook implementation can be found in Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb..
The trained model is saved as Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.h5 ,which can be used to make predictions easily.
